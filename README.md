## Random Numbers
A) Generate samples of (x, y) coordinates that fill a square uniformly such that x & y values fall in a range between -1 and +1. Be able to specify the number of xy-pairs to be generated, N_total.

B) Count the number of points in your sample that happen to fall inside the inscribed circle centered at the origin with a radius = 1, N_circle. Calculate the ratio: Ratio = (4(N_circle))/N_total

C) Plot the sampled data over the entire range of the square. Please inscribe the circle used in part B. Points outside of the circle color red and points inside the circle color blue for N_total = 10,000.

D) Plot the ratio you calculated as a function of N_total. Vary N_total from 10 to 10^6. Does this ratio converge to a finite value? What should this value be? Does this make sense? Draw a dashed horizontal line denoting the expected ratio value.
